//prototype 12/7 just testing the waters NOTE TO SELF = should we be able to defeat the ghost or maybe something else without the flashlight????


//there is a ghost in the game that is hidden in a room. you must defeat it.
// but how?
// start with the basics. attack, run and defend == if we decide that you are able to attack it, need more reasearch!!


//lets fix this tomorrow to make it a litle better
//attack would not do anything but prompt ''what were you thinking it is a ghost. i know, why have it then? would you not fight for your life if you could?
//run would mean you just closed the door.
//defend would be the key to defeat the ghost, pherhapes with a flashlight? or a soulstone maybe. we will figure that out later.
